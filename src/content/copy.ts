export const ABOUT_LONG = `Perched close to the shoreline of Sidi Ifni, Ifni Sunset Auberge is a small, family-run guesthouse built around one simple idea: evenings that feel like a pause. Our rooms are designed for comfort — clean linens, private bathrooms and simple, thoughtful details — while common areas invite lingering: the terrace faces west for uninterrupted sunsets, the communal lounge welcomes conversation, and our restaurant serves seasonal local dishes.

Guests come here for the sea, the light and the relaxed pace. Mornings may begin with a walk along the beach or a surf lesson; afternoons are for hammocks, reading and discovering the nearby markets; evenings are for warm dinners and the slow descent of the sun. Practical comforts — complimentary Wi‑Fi throughout the property, free parking, 24‑hour reception and airport transfers on request — keep the stay effortless. We welcome solo travelers, couples and groups who want an authentic coastal base to explore Sidi Ifni and the Guelmim‑Es Smara region.

Book directly to secure the sunset terrace rooms or use our verified booking link. After you reserve, we’ll send arrival details including the property phone number and directions. We can advise on surf spots, guided walks and local experiences to tailor your stay.`
